*DESCRIPTION*:

I was assigned the task of designing and simulating a digital Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using Verilog HDL, with the goal of understanding digital signal processing concepts and their implementation in hardware. FIR filters are widely used in signal processing applications due to their inherent stability and linear phase characteristics. The objective of this project was to design a functional FIR filter capable of performing convolution on input digital signals and verify its operation through simulation using an industry-standard Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool. The design process began with defining the filter specifications, including the filter order, cutoff frequency, and the type of response (low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass). A small-order low-pass FIR filter was chosen for ease of implementation, with coefficients calculated using standard windowing techniques. These coefficients were stored in a register array in Verilog to represent the tap weights of the filter. The FIR filter structure was implemented using a series of multiply-accumulate (MAC) units, where each input sample was multiplied by the corresponding coefficient, and the results were summed to produce the filter output. The Verilog implementation included a clock input, a synchronous reset, input data, and output data signals, ensuring that the filter operated in a fully synchronous manner.After writing the Verilog code for the FIR filter, a comprehensive testbench was developed to verify its functionality. The testbench generated a sequence of digital input signals, including step, impulse, and sinusoidal signals, to observe the filter’s response under various conditions. The input stimuli were applied in a timed sequence aligned with the clock signal, ensuring proper synchronization with the filter’s operation. The testbench also monitored the output at each clock cycle and compared it with the expected response calculated using MATLAB for validation purposes. Once the Verilog module and testbench were complete, the EDA tool was used to compile, simulate, and analyse the filter’s behaviour. The EDA environment provided a robust platform for waveform visualization, timing analysis, and debugging, which was crucial for verifying the correctness of the FIR filter.In the simulation phase, the Verilog code was compiled and any warnings or syntax errors were resolved. The EDA tool then allowed the simulation to run and display the waveforms of input, output, and intermediate signals in real time. By examining the waveform outputs, it was verified that each input sample was multiplied by the corresponding coefficient and accumulated correctly over successive clock cycles. For example, when an impulse input was applied, the output waveform clearly displayed the filter coefficients as the output sequence, which is the expected behaviour of an FIR filter. Similarly, for sinusoidal inputs, the output waveform showed the attenuation or amplification of specific frequency components, demonstrating the filter’s frequency-selective characteristics.The EDA tool also provided features such as signal tracing, zooming into specific clock cycles, and measuring propagation delays, which allowed detailed analysis of the timing performance of the FIR filter and ensured that all operations occurred synchronously without glitches. Additionally, the waveform viewer was used to compare the simulated output with theoretical expectations, confirming the accuracy of the Verilog implementation. Multiple simulation snapshots were captured, including impulse response, step response, and sinusoidal response, and included in the simulation report. These results confirmed that the FIR filter produced correct outputs and exhibited expected characteristics such as linear phase response and stability.Overall, this project provided valuable hands-on experience in designing a digital FIR filter in Verilog and verifying its operation through EDA-based simulation. It offered practical knowledge of hardware implementation of signal processing algorithms, synchronous design techniques, and debugging using professional EDA tools. The simulation results demonstrated that the FIR filter met the specified requirements and operated reliably across different input signals. This task significantly enhanced understanding of digital filters, Verilog coding practices, and the importance of simulation in validating digital hardware. I am grateful to Codtech for providing me with this excellent opportunity to work on a real-world digital signal processing project and gain practical engineering experience in hardware design and verification.
